/*
The main letter

    1. Apply the CSS to the HTML.
    2. Add a background declaration to the letter that:
        Fixes the top image to the top of the letter
        Fixes the the bottom image to the bottom of the letter
        Adds a semi-transparent gradient over the top of both of the previous backgrounds that gives the letter a bit of texture. Make it slightly dark right near the top and bottom, but completely transparent for a large part of the center.
    3. Add another background declaration that just adds the top image to the top of the letter, as a fallback for browsers that don't support the previous declaration.
    4. Add a white background color to the letter.
    Add a 1mm top and bottom solid border to the letter, in a color that is inkeeping with the rest of the color scheme.

The logo

    1. To the <h1>, add the logo as a background image.
    2. Add a filter to the logo to give it a subtle drop shadow.
    3. Now comment out the filter and implement the drop shadow in a different (slightly more cross-browser compatible) way, which still follows the shape of the round image.
